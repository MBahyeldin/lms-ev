<p>Angular makes heavy use of classes - a feature that's supported by vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript (though TypeScript "extends" it and adds some extra features as you'll see).</p><p>A class is essentially a blueprint for objects. Any properties and methods defined in the class will exist on all objects that are created based on the class.</p><p>For example, if you had this class (in vanilla JavaScript):</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name =&nbsp;name;
    this.age =&nbsp;age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log('Hi, I am&nbsp;' + this.name);
  }
}</pre><p>You could instantiate it (and create objects) like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">const person1 =&nbsp;new Person('Max', 35);
const person2 =&nbsp;new Person('Anna', 32);</pre><p>And you could then access the properties and methods defined by the class:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">console.log(person1.age);
person2.greet();</pre><p>When using Angular, you'll often define classes which are NEVER instantiated by you!</p><p>For example, components are created as classes - i.e., you create blueprints for custom HTML&nbsp;elements. But it's Angular that actually instantiates the classes in the end. You never call <code>new SomeComponent()</code> anywhere in your code.</p><p>In addition, Angular uses TypeScript - therefore, you often use TS-supported "enhancements"&nbsp;to classes.</p><p>For example decorators:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">@Component({})
class SomeComponent {}</pre><p>Decorators like <code>@Component</code> are used by Angular to add metadata &amp; configuration to classes (and other things, as you'll see throughout the course).</p><p>In addition, TypeScript gives you more control over how properties are defined in classes.</p><p>You can, for example, mark properties (and methods) as <code>private</code>, <code>public</code> (the default) and <code>protected</code> to control which parts of your code can access which property (or method). You can learn more about these keywords <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#member-visibility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. </p><p>And, in general, you can learn more about TypeScript's support for classes <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. </p><p>That being said, you don't have to study classes in-depth right now. You'll see most of those important features in action throughout this course.</p><p>For the moment, it's just important to understand that this classes feature exists, what it does (= create blueprints for objects) and how to work with classes.</p>
