<p>As mentioned, the "Angular Signals"&nbsp;feature is <strong>not finished</strong> yet!</p><p>Whilst the foundation (creating signals, reading signals, updating signals)&nbsp;is fully implemented - as a developer preview, though - some more advanced features are still <strong>missing</strong>.</p><p><strong>Signal-based components</strong>, for example.</p><p>In the future, you'll be able to mark components as signal-based&nbsp;(presumably by adding the <code>signals: true</code> flag to <code>@Component</code>) to let Angular know that it should not use its regular change detection algorithm in such components.</p><p>And that's just one feature, of course. In signal-based components, you'll also be able to get rid of many decorators like <code>@Input()</code> or <code>@Output()</code> (and others). You would use special functions instead:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">@Input() title: string;</pre><p>would become</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">title =&nbsp;input&lt;string&gt;();</pre><p>for example.</p><p>But, again, this part is still missing! It's likely to be added with Angular 17.</p><p>You can learn more about the complete planned (!)&nbsp;Signals API in the official RFCs: <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/49685" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/49685</a></p><p>Please note that this RFC&nbsp;is split up into four "sub-RFCs" that dive deeper into specific aspects of Angular.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/49682" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this sub-RFC</a> takes a closer look at the signal-based&nbsp;components mentioned above.</p>
