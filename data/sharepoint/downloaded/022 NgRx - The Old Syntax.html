<p>Originally, this section was recorded based on an <strong>older version of NgRx</strong>. This version required more verbose code and is not recommended anymore.</p><p>But if you find yourself working on a project that uses an older version of NgRx OR if you want to see NgRx applied to the "Recipe Book"&nbsp;course project, you might find that old content interesting.</p><p>I&nbsp;had to unpublish the lectures to make room for new course content, that's why <strong>attached to this lecture</strong> you find ZIP&nbsp;files that contain the old videos and attachments. So, if you're interested in that old content, you can download those ZIP&nbsp;files to watch those old videos.</p><p>The old videos start with video 4, since the first three videos simply explained what NgRx is - something you already know by now :).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Some things to keep in mind:</strong></p><p><strong>1)</strong>&nbsp;We'll install NgRx via <code>npm install --save @ngrx/store</code> =&gt;&nbsp;You could use <code>ng add @ngrx/store</code> instead (as shown in the previous lectures)</p><p><strong>2)</strong> We'll use the <strong>"old"&nbsp;actions, reducers &amp;&nbsp;effects syntax</strong> (i.e., without <code>createAction()</code>, <code>createReducer()</code> and <code>createEffect()</code>)</p><p>=&gt;&nbsp;With the exception of the old effects syntax (which uses <code>@Effect()</code>, which is not supported anymore), you <strong>can stick to that syntax</strong>. Alternatively, you can switch to the approach you learned about in the previous lectures.</p><p>As mentioned, you'll find <strong>multiple code snapshot attachments</strong> in the attached ZIP&nbsp;File - snapshots with the "old" and "new" syntax. This should make following along easy &amp; straightforward.</p>
