<p>In the previous lecture, you were introduced to <strong>"Property Binding"</strong>&nbsp;- a key Angular feature that allows you to bind element properties to dynamic values.</p><p>For example, <code>&lt;img [src]="someSrc"&gt;</code> binds the <code>src</code> property of the underlying <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTMLImageElement</a> DOM&nbsp;object to the value stored in <code>someSrc</code>.</p><p>Whilst it might look like you're binding the src attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag, you're actually NOT&nbsp;doing that. Instead, property binding really targets the underlying DOM object property (in this case a property that's also called <code>src</code>) and binds that.</p><p>This might look like a subtle detail (and often it indeed doesn't matter) but it's important to understand this difference between element attributes and property. <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2024/attributes-vs-properties/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This article</a> can help with understanding this difference.</p><p>Whilst it won't make a difference in Angular apps in many cases, it DOES&nbsp;matter if you're trying to set attributes on elements dynamically. Attributes which don't have an equally-named underlying property.</p><p>For example, when binding <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ARIA attributes</a>, you can't target an underlying DOM object property. </p><p>Since "Property Binding" wants to target properties (and not attributes), that can be a problem. That's why Angular offers a slight variation of the "Property Binding" syntax that does allow you to bind attributes to dynamic values.</p><p>It looks like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;div 
  role="progressbar" 
  [attr.aria-valuenow]="currentVal" 
  [attr.aria-valuemax]="maxVal"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>By adding <code>attr</code> in front of the attribute name you want to bind dynamically, you're <em>"telling"</em> Angular that it shouldn't try to find a property with the specified name but instead bind the respective attribute - in the example above, the <code>aria-valuenow</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code> attributes would be bound dynamically.</p>
