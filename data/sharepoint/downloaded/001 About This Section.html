<p>This section (and the following sections) is /&nbsp;are part of the "old Angular course". </p><p><strong>I'm currently working on a big update to this course</strong> - the first part of this update was released on May 23rd, the second big chunk will be released on June 17th.</p><p>That being said, you can absolutely still continue with this and the next sections since the syntax &amp;&nbsp;features you'll learn there will still work (and are indeed still used in a huge number of Angular projects).</p><p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;This section is again about practicing important Angular basics. BUT this section uses older Angular syntax - it does NOT use standalone components and does NOT&nbsp;use signals (because it's part of the older course, see above).</p><p>Nonetheless, you can continue with this and the next sections as the syntax shown here is still valid and will still be used in many Angular projects out there. Also feel free to migrate to standalone components and signals on your own.</p>
