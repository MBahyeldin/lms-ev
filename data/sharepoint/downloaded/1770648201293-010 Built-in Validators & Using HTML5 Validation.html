<p>Which Validators do ship with Angular?&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the Validators class:&nbsp;<a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/Validators" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://angular.io/api/forms/Validators</a> - these are all built-in validators, though that are the methods which actually get executed (and which you later can add when using the reactive approach).</p><p>For the template-driven approach, you need the directives. You can find out their names, by searching for "validator" in the official docs:&nbsp;<a href="https://angular.io/api?type=directive" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://angular.io/api?type=directive</a> - everything marked with "D" is a directive and can be added to your template.</p><p>Additionally, you might also want to enable&nbsp;HTML5 validation (by default, Angular disables it). You can do so by adding the <code>ngNativeValidate</code>&nbsp; to a control in your template.</p>
