<p>If you're in an <strong>Angular 17</strong> project (and only then!), you can also use an <strong>alternative syntax</strong> for outputting conditional content:</p><p>Instead of using <code>*ngIf</code>, you can use a built-in <code>@if</code>&nbsp;template control flow statement.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">@if (someCondition) {
  &lt;p&gt;Only visible if 'someCondition'&nbsp;is true&lt;/p&gt;
}</pre><p>would replace</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;p *ngIf="someCondition"&gt;Only visible if 'someCondition'&nbsp;is true&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>The advantage of the new syntax is that it can be slightly more efficient under the hood and that it does not rely on <code>NgIf</code> or the <code>CommonModule</code> being imported /&nbsp;available.</p><p>Using it is entirely <strong>optional</strong>! It's also worth noting that this new syntax is only available in <strong>"Developer Preview"</strong>&nbsp;right now and therefore may change in the future!</p><p>You can learn more about this syntax <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/templates/control-flow#if-block-conditionals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. And I'll share more details in an upcoming course update (which you'll get for free &amp; which I'll announce once it's done)&nbsp;:-)</p>
