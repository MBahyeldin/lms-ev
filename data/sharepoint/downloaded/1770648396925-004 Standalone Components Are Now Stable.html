<p>As mentioned in the previous lecture, Angular 14 introduced standalone components in "Preview Mode". With <strong>Angular 15</strong>, this feature now became <strong>stable</strong> (the syntax didn't change though).</p><p>You may now use standalone components instead of NgModules in production-ready apps.&nbsp;And, as will be shown throughout this section, you can also mix and match the concepts as needed.</p><p>But should you use standalone components in all scenarios?</p><p>Well, for the moment, that's probably a "No". Especially for large, very complex applications, NgModules reduce the amount of boilerplate code (imports etc.)&nbsp;that needs to be written. NgModules can also help with structuring dependency injection, bundling features together and more.</p><p>But this may change in the future, as Angular continues to evolve and new patterns may emerge.</p><p>I'll of course keep this course updated to reflect any changes that may occur.</p>
