<p>This section (and the following sections) is /&nbsp;are part of the "<strong>old Angular course</strong>". </p><p>The following sections were recorded with older Angular versions (i.e., &lt;18). They do not use standalone components and signals, for example.</p><p>Therefore, <strong>you can ignore these old sections</strong> (and mark them as "Completed"&nbsp;manually, if course progress is important for you).</p><p>But if you know that you'll be working with an older Angular version, the following sections may be very valuable for you.</p><p>Angular has a quite fragmented version landscape - there are many Angular projects that still use Angular 9, 10 etc. That's why I decided to keep this old course online for now. Eventually, once I&nbsp;see consumption drop significantly, these old sections will be removed (I&nbsp;will, of course, send an announcement before doing that, though). But for the time being, they stay online to teach you how to work with older Angular versions.</p><p>For this and the next sections, it's worth noting that you should follow along with the <strong>attached starting project</strong> since a brand-new Angular project would be missing some setup steps that are required for this and the next sections.</p>
