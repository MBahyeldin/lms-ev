<p>Here are some hints that hopefully help you solve this exercise. If not - no problem, we'll solve it together over the next lectures! :-)</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>project structure</strong> of this section has <strong>one important difference</strong> compared to the structure from the previous section: Images (and statically served assets in general) are now stored in the <code>public/</code> folder - NOT in a nested <code>assets/</code> folder!</p></li><li><p>To reference images stored in the <code>public/</code> folder you would use a path like this: <code>&lt;img src="some-image.png"&gt;</code> - i.e., the <code>public</code> folder name is NOT part of that path (it's NOT&nbsp;<code>&lt;img src="public/some-image.png"&gt;</code>)</p></li><li><p>The <code>investment-results.ts</code> file contains code that you can use to calculate annual investment results - you might need to move that code into a different place though (e.g., into some component or service method or anything like that)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;Use it as a starting point &amp;&nbsp;help but don't be afraid to change it!</p></li><li><p>To output the calculated investment results, a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> will be rendered (in my solution, over the next lectures) =&gt;&nbsp;If you're not feeling confident with using the HTML&nbsp;<code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element, you can instead also render regular <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s (or any other element)&nbsp;and set up basic styling on your own</p></li><li><p>If you do go for a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, keep in mind that you'll likely need to work with <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> &amp;&nbsp;<code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> (as well as <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> etc.) to achieve the desired look</p></li><li><p>When using a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> also make sure to NOT split the table elements into multiple components =&gt;&nbsp;this would break styling since extra DOM&nbsp;element (=&gt; your component elements) would be introduced into the markup</p></li><li><p>You might need to define some TypeScript types - e.g., for describing the shapes of objects or arrays</p><ul><li><p>Object types are defined like this:&nbsp;<code>type MyObj = { someProp1: string;&nbsp;someProp2: number};</code></p></li><li><p>Array types are defined like this:&nbsp;<code>string[]</code>, <code>number[]</code>, <code>MyObj[]</code> etc.</p></li><li><p>To define properties or parameters as optional, you can add a <code>?</code>&nbsp;after the name: e.g., <code>someProp?: string;</code></p></li><li><p>To allow for multiple types in a single value you can use <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union Types</a>: <code>myVal:&nbsp;number | string</code></p></li></ul></li><li><p>To format the currency values appropriately, you could consider using Angular's built-in <a href="https://angular.dev/api/common/CurrencyPipe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CurrencyPipe</a></p></li></ul>
