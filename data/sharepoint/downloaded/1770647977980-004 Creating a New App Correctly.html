<p><strong>MUST&nbsp;READ</strong></p><p>In the next lecture, we set up the course project. </p><p>Make sure, you do create that app by also adding the <code>--no-strict</code>, <code>--routing false</code> and <code>--standalone false</code> flags to the <code>ng new</code> command - otherwise you will run into issues later on (we'll still dive into that "Strict Mode"&nbsp;later in the course of course, no worries)!</p><p>We'll also install the Bootstrap CSS&nbsp;Framework and in this course, we use version 3 of the framework. Install it via <code>npm install --save bootstrap@3</code>&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp;The <code>@3</code>&nbsp; is important!</p><p>Additionally, when using a project created with Angular CLI&nbsp;6+ (check via <code>ng v</code>&nbsp;), you'll have an <code>angular.json</code>&nbsp; file instead of an <code>.angular-cli.json </code>&nbsp;file. In that file, you still need to add Bootstrap to the <code>styles[]</code>&nbsp; array as shown in the next video, but the path should be <code>node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css</code>&nbsp;, <strong>NOT</strong> <code>../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css</code>&nbsp;. The leading <code>../</code>&nbsp; must not be included.</p><p>Also see this lecture - I&nbsp;do show the complete setup process there:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655614/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655614/</a></p><p>If you're facing any problems, please have a look at this very thorough thread by Jost:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/lecture/17862130#questions/10444944" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/lecture/17862130#questions/10444944</a></p>
